# Check the experiry date and type of a certificate

__credit to Koos for this suggestion__

* use the boiler plate software
* first run pip install -r requirements

## Final Goal
    * Read from a file the domains you should check and last checked date time should be 24 hours ago
    * Each domain is checked with your code 
    * Result is written back to a file with the last check date - time
    * If domain is about to experiy within 2 months put that domain in a separate file
          

## First challege:

Print the expirty dates of 3 choosen domains to your screen. You may "hard-code" these domains in the code

## Second challenge

Print this to a CSV file

## Challenge 3: 

Read the domains you want to check from a file 

# Hints

* __use the boilerplate code__
* to run a command in manager.py go the boilerplate directory
   ```bash
    python3 manager.py check_certificates_csv
 
```
